    and type is one of:

      nfs
      url

    Defines a shell or python script to be invoked at the defined
    stage. Args passed to the script:

      installation-start - None

      filesystem-populated - mnt (mount point of root filesystem)

      installation-complete - 0 | 1 (success or failure)

  <post-install-script type="type">url</post-install-script>[D]

    If 'type' is 'nfs' then 'url' is taken to be an nfs location,
    else 'url' is treated as a url determined by its protocol.

    Replaced by <script stage="filesystem-populated">

  <install-failed-script>url</install-failed-script>[D]

    Replaced by <script stage="installation-complete">
